This is an opinionated command line AI code tool. I'll write more about it later, but rather than having AI in my editor, I want AI as a tool that lives in my codebase/system. I also want it integrated more with language analysis information, including LSPs, linting, and compiling.

This is also an opportunity for me to play with AI more directly myself. While the initial code was largely done with Cursor or manually, the project is now at the point where it can edit itself (or at least a copy of itself, so there's always one working instance!).
